* Test Cases
  Unit tests:
  1. Tests for existence of resource files.
  2. Tests for when resource files are well formed.
  3. Tests for when resource files are NOT well formed:
     - file contains leading newline/spaces
     - file is empty
     - file does not contain name and/or version
  4. Test for when both feature flag files are the same
  5. Test for when both feature flag files are NOT the same:
     - one is different
     - both are different
  6. Test for when one feature flag file exists and the other one was deleted
  7. Test for when both feature flag files were deleted
  8. Test when current name/version is the FIRST entry in *release_info.csv* -> no previous version, so can't lookup FF.csv from previous ref -> output meaningful message
  9. Test when current name/version is the LAST entry in *release_info.csv* -> there is no next version, so update should fail with meaningful message
  10. Tests for Git operations:
     - test that remote branch exists (name according to release name and release version) -> if not throw exception with meaningful message
     - test that response code is valid when sending GitHub API request -> if not throw exception with meaningful message
     - test that file exists from ref -> if not throw exception with meaningful message
     - test that API requests return valid responses -> if not then output meaningful message
